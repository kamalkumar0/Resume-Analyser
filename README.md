# 🧾 Resume Analyzer (AI + NLP Based)

This project is an AI-based Resume Analyzer that helps users understand how strong their resume is and whether it is ATS-friendly or not.

The idea behind building this project was simple — many students and job seekers don’t know why their resumes get rejected. So I created a tool that analyzes resumes using NLP techniques and gives feedback like extracted skills, score, and improvement suggestions.
